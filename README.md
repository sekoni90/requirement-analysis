# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

This repository is for learning and practicing requirement analysis in software development.

## What is Requirement Analysis?
Requirement analysis is the process of defining and documenting the requirements of a software system. It involves identifying the needs and constraints of the system, and creating a clear and concise document that outlines what the system should do.

Requirement analysis is an essential part of the software development lifecycle (SDLC) because it helps ensure that the system meets the needs of its users and stakeholders. It also helps to identify and manage the risks associated with the project, and to create a clear understanding of the project's scope and timeline.

## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?
Requirement analysis is critical in the SDLC for the following reasons:

* **Improves Communication**: Requirement analysis helps to ensure that all stakeholders have a clear understanding of the system's requirements, which improves communication and reduces the risk of misunderstandings.
* **Reduces Errors**: By identifying and documenting the requirements early on, requirement analysis helps to reduce the risk of errors and defects in the system.
* **Increases Efficiency**: Requirement analysis helps to ensure that the system is designed and developed with the user's needs in mind, which increases the system's efficiency and effectiveness.

## Key Activities in Requirement Analysis
The following are the key activities involved in requirement analysis:

* **Requirement Gathering**: Collecting information about the system's requirements from stakeholders and users.
* **Requirement Elicitation**: Identifying and extracting the requirements from the gathered information.
* **Requirement Documentation**: Documenting the requirements in a clear and concise manner.
* **Requirement Analysis and Modeling**: Analyzing and modeling the requirements to ensure they are complete and consistent.
* **Requirement Validation**: Verifying that the requirements meet the needs of the users and stakeholders.

## Types of Requirements
### Functional Requirements
Functional requirements describe what the system should do. They define the system's functionality and behavior.

Examples of functional requirements for a booking management system:

* The system should allow users to search for available rooms.
* The system should allow users to book a room.
* The system should send a confirmation email to the user after booking.

### Non-functional Requirements
Non-functional requirements describe how the system should perform its functions. They define the system's quality and performance characteristics.

Examples of non-functional requirements for a booking management system:

* The system should respond to user queries within 2 seconds.
* The system should be available 24/7.
* The system should be secure and protect user data.

## Use Case Diagrams
A use case diagram is a graphical representation of the system's functional requirements. It shows the interactions between the system's actors and the system's use cases.

## Acceptance Criteria
Acceptance criteria are the conditions that must be met for a system to be accepted by the users and stakeholders. They define the system's functional and non-functional requirements.

Example of acceptance criteria for the Checkout feature in the booking management system:

* The system should allow users to checkout successfully.
* The system should send a confirmation email to the user after checkout.
* The system should update the room's availability status after checkout.
